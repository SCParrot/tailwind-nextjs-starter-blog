### Recommended Workflow Overview (Most Common, Least Risky)

```
Upstream Repository (Others)  →  Sync Regularly to  →  Your Fork Main Branch (Usually main/master)
                                                        ↓
                                              Develop Your Features on feature/xxx Branch
                                                        ↓
                                        Submit PR to Upstream (Optional) or Keep in Your Repo
```

### Step 1: Fork the Project (Everyone Knows This)

Simply click the **Fork** button on GitHub
→ Get `https://github.com/your-username/original-project-name`

### Step 2: Add Upstream as Remote (Super Important! Do Once Only)

After cloning your fork locally, execute the following commands (**Do Once in Lifetime**):

```bash
# Enter project directory
cd your-project-folder

# View current remotes (usually only origin)
git remote -v

# Add upstream repository (upstream is the convention, you can name it anything but recommend using this)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author/original-project-name.git

# View again, should see two remotes
git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/your-username/original-project-name.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/your-username/original-project-name.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/original-author/original-project-name.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/original-author/original-project-name.git (push)
```

### Step 3: Three Main Ways to Sync Upstream Updates Daily (Choose Your Favorite)

#### Way 1: Easiest (Recommended for Most People) — Direct Sync on Web Page

1. Open your own fork repository page
2. See the prompt "This branch is X commits behind original-author:main"
3. Click the **Sync fork** button → **Update branch**

Pros: Fastest, most foolproof
Cons: If there are conflicts, you can only resolve them by creating a PR (more complicated)

#### Way 2: Most Flexible, Recommended for Long-term Maintenance (Local merge/rebase)

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Fetch latest content from upstream (won't change anything on your local)
git fetch upstream

# 3. Two merge strategies to choose from:
  
# Option A: Preserve merge history (safer, recommended for beginners)
git merge upstream/main

# Option B: Keep history cleaner (used by advanced users, but be careful)
git rebase upstream/main
   # If conflicts → Resolve conflicts → git rebase --continue

# 4. Regardless of which you chose, push to your own repo after completion
git push origin main
# If rebase was used and you pushed before, may need force push (be careful!)
# git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

#### Way 3: GitHub CLI One-click Sync (Increasingly Popular Since 2023)

Install GitHub CLI first (if not installed yet): https://cli.github.com

```bash
# One command to sync directly (sync remote repo, no local operations needed)
gh repo sync your-username/your-fork-repo-name --branch main

# If conflicts arise, you'll need to fall back to Way 2 to resolve locally
```

### Step 4: What to Do with Your Own Modifications? (Most Important!)

**Golden Rule**: **Never write your own code directly on main/master branch!**

Correct approach:

```bash
# Every time you want to add new features/make changes, create new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
# Or
git checkout -b fix/fix-some-bug

# ... Modify code, commit ...
  
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Added XXX feature"

# Push to your own repo
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

This way your main branch can cleanly sync upstream continuously, while all your personalized modifications are safely kept in various feature branches.

### Quick Reference Table - What to Do in Different Situations

| What You Want to Do              | Recommended Way        | Notes                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Just want quick sync, no own code| Web Sync fork          | Fastest                           |
| Long-term fork maintenance, own changes | Local fetch + merge    | Safest, most controllable         |
| Pursue clean history line        | Local fetch + rebase   | Elegant after mastering           |
| Lazy to open local, remote one-click | gh repo sync           | Still needs local handling on conflicts |
| Upstream updates very frequent   | GitHub Actions Auto-sync | Good for bot/theme/template repos |

Remember one sentence:

**"Main branch only responsible for upstream, all your valuable modifications should be placed in feature/xxx branches"**
This is the survival rule that 90% of long-term fork maintainers eventually follow.

Wish you happy forking and smooth syncing ~ 🚀
