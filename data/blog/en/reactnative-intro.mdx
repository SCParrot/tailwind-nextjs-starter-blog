In mobile app development, "develop once, run on multiple platforms" has always been the goal pursued by developers. **React Native** was born under this backdrop — it allows us to use **JavaScript / TypeScript and React concepts** to build truly native-like iOS and Android apps.

---

## What is React Native?

**React Native (RN)** is an open-source cross-platform mobile development framework launched by Facebook (Meta).
It doesn't simply wrap web pages in a WebView, but instead uses a **native component mapping mechanism** to render React components as genuine native UI.

This is also the biggest difference between React Native and traditional Hybrid solutions.

---

## Core Advantages of React Native ✨

### 1️⃣ Genuine Native Experience

React Native uses native components (such as `View`, `Text`, `Image`), delivering performance and interaction experiences close to native apps, significantly superior to WebView-based solutions.

### 2️⃣ Cross-Platform Development, Cost Savings

One codebase can run on both **iOS / Android**, dramatically reducing development and maintenance costs, especially suitable for small-to-medium teams and rapidly iterating products.

### 3️⃣ Familiar React Development Model

If you already master **React Hooks, component-based thinking, state management**, you can almost seamlessly start with React Native.

### 4️⃣ Hot Updates and Rapid Iteration

Supports **Fast Refresh**, where code modifications are immediately visible, resulting in very high development efficiency ⚡

## How React Native Works 🧠

React Native doesn't directly manipulate native UI, but instead follows this process:

1. JavaScript code runs in JS engine (Hermes / JSC)
2. React generates Virtual DOM
3. RN framework passes updates through Bridge (or new architecture) to native layer
4. Native layer renders corresponding UI components

With the introduction of the **New Architecture (Fabric + TurboModules)**, React Native has seen significant improvements in performance and communication efficiency.

---

## What Scenarios Is React Native Suitable For?

React Native is very suitable for the following scenarios:

* 📱 Content Apps (news, communities, utility apps)
* 🛒 E-commerce, event pages, marketing apps
* 🚀 Rapid MVP validation
* 🧩 Products requiring unified iOS / Android experience

However, for **high-performance games, heavy animations, deep system customization** scenarios, native development still has advantages.

---

## A Simple React Native Example

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Hello React Native 🚀</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
  },
});
```

From the code, you can see that React Native is very similar to React, but uses **cross-platform native components and styling systems**.

## React Native vs Flutter 🤔

| Comparison Item | React Native            | Flutter |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| Language        | JavaScript / TypeScript | Dart    |
| UI Rendering    | Native Components       | Custom Engine    |
| Learning Curve  | Low (for React users)   | Medium  |
| Native Integration | Very Flexible          | Relatively Complex    |

If you have React ecosystem background, **React Native is a very natural choice**.

---

## Ecosystem & Tool Recommendations 🧰

* **Expo**: Quick start and build RN apps
* **React Navigation**: Routing and navigation
* **Redux / Zustand / Recoil**: State management
* **Axios / React Query**: Data requests and caching
* **Hermes**: High-performance JS engine

---

## Summary

React Native continues to occupy an important position in cross-platform development.
It strikes a good balance between **development efficiency, community ecosystem, and native experience**, making it a reliable choice for building mobile apps.

If you want to use familiar React tech stack to quickly create high-quality mobile apps, **React Native is worth trying** 💡
