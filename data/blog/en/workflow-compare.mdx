| Project    | Type Positioning                 | Core Advantages                          | Biggest Pain Points                   | Community/Ecosystem Activity in 2026 | Suitable Audience (Recommendation Index) | China-Friendly |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| n8n        | General Workflow Automation (Node-based) | Extremely flexible, supports almost all services, strong self-hosting | Steep learning curve, average UI aesthetics | ★★★★★                               | Intermediate to Advanced Automation Engineers ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆         |
| Dify       | AI Application Development Platform (LLMOps) | Best RAG + Agent + Workflow combination | Self-hosting requires higher server specs, some advanced features closed-source | ★★★★½                               | Teams wanting complete AI products ★★★★★   | ★★★★★         |
| Coze       | Conversational Bot + Plugin Workflow | Extremely low barrier, fastest to get started, ByteDance-backed ecosystem | Weak deep customization, heavily platform-dependent | ★★★★                                | Operations/Growth/Sales/Beginners for quick bots ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★         |
| LangChain  | AI Application Framework (Code-focused) | Theoretically most flexible, largest community, richest components | Poor engineering, average production stability | ★★★★★                               | Developers willing to write lots of code ★★★★ | ★★★★          |

### Core Dimension Comparison Table (Real Feelings in January 2026)

| Comparison Dimension      | n8n                           | Dify                              | Coze                           | LangChain                       | Winner (Subjective) |

| Complex Agent/RAG Capability | ★★★★                        | ★★★★★                             | ★★½                            | ★★★★★                           | Dify ≈ LangChain   |
| Workflow Visual Editing Experience | ★★★★★ (Smoothest node-based) | ★★★★                              | ★★★                            | None (Pure Code)                | n8n               |
| Self-Hosting Difficulty   | Low (Docker one-click)        | Medium-High                       | No self-hosting support        | Very High (Handle everything yourself) | n8n               |
| Domestic Network/Model Compatibility | Very Good (Supports many domestic models) | Excellent (Officially supports domestic well) | Perfect (ByteDance)            | Depends on your integration       | Dify ≈ Coze       |
| Production Usability/Stability | ★★★★½ (Community version sufficient) | ★★★★ (Enterprise version more stable) | ★★★★ (Platform responsible)    | ★★～★★★ (Depends on team engineering) | —                 |
| Community/Templates/Plugin Richness | Very Rich                 | Rapidly growing                   | Official + User plugins abundant | Largest ecosystem               | LangChain         |
| Monthly Cost (Medium-scale usage) | Nearly 0 (Self-hosted) ~ hundreds | Hundreds to thousands (Cloud/Self-hosted) | Free tier → hundreds to thousands | Mainly depends on model costs     | n8n               |
| Typical Delivery Speed (Build customer service + knowledge base) | 2~5 days | 1~3 days | Hours ~ 1 day | 3 days ~ 2 weeks | Coze > Dify       |

### Real Scenario Recommendations (Most Practical Suggestions for Early 2026)

| Who You Are / What You Want to Do | Strongly Recommended First Choice | Secondary Options | Brief Reason for Not Recommended |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Individual/Small Team, want fastest monetizable AI product/Bot | Coze | Dify | Coze is truly fastest from 0 to 1 |
| Company building knowledge base + customer service + multi-Agent collaboration system | Dify | n8n + Dify combination | Dify currently offers the most balanced RAG + Agent experience |
| Need to integrate dozens/hundreds of systems, create super complex automation workflows | n8n | Make + n8n | n8n's node system remains the "Swiss Army Knife" of automation |
| Want to deeply research, create cutting-edge complex Agents, willing to write lots of code | LangChain / LlamaIndex | LangGraph + FastAPI | Only choose if you want to "build wheels" or pursue ultimate control |
| Extremely low budget, only want self-hosting, model flexibility | n8n + Ollama/Local models | Dify self-hosted | n8n self-hosting is lightest |
| Large company/compliance requires intranet deployment | Dify Enterprise / n8n | Self-built LangChain system | Coze basically out |
  
### 2026 One-Sentence Summary (Most Honest Version)

- **Want speed, simplicity, survival** → Coze
- **Want relatively complete, attractive, commercializable, iterative AI products** → Dify
- **Want to be the "tool master," connect everything, automate everything** → n8n
- **Want to conduct research, write papers, create most cutting-edge and complex Agents** → LangChain / LangGraph

Most ordinary developers and small teams' real path in 2026 probably looks like this:

**Coze → Validate idea → Earn first money → Migrate/Refactor to Dify → Need more complex automation → Introduce n8n → Finally fed up with black box → Rewrite with LangChain myself**

Which stage are you at now?
